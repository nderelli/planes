## Planes

A theme built for the annual Poster Show and Auction presented by the Visual Communication Design (VCD) program at Arizona State University.

Posters are donated by designers, artists, and firms from around the world. All proceeds from the auction help fund the VCD Senior Show, an exhibition to be held in Spring 2014.

### Features

- Poster: Custom Post Type
- Clock: Custom Post Type

### Considerations

This theme is meant to present a large number of posters that will be auctioned. This means that **the site is inherently image-heavy**. How is this addressed to users accessing the site from a mobile device? Are all of the images loaded at once? 

### Todos

- [x] Make clock & poster custom post types
- [ ] Detailed information on posters. 2 sided? Printing method? Signed?
- [ ] Allow posters/clocks to be sorted
- [ ] Fine-tune grid system for posters vs clocks. Circular forms need subtle changes in lining up, etc.
- [ ] Get 'Information' page and information from it without having to navigate away from posters/clocks.

#### Colophon

Built for Wordpress, with Sass, and includes a codekit-config fileâ€” so you can jump right in.
This theme requires [Advanced Custom Fields](https://github.com/elliotcondon/acf).
